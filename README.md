# KnapSolver

Solver for the knapsack problem with a simple GUI. Allows user to input files with instances of the knapsack problem and select from several algorithms.
KnapSolver is currently offering brute force algorithms for the decision and construct version of the problem.
Greedy, greedyRedux, dynamic and fptas algorithm for the construct version.

KnapSolver is a reimplementation of my c++ solution of the semestral work for NI-KOP course at FIT CTU.
